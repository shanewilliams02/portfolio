                <p class="section-text">HelloNeighbor is an in-home elder care startup created to help customers find, schedule, and purchase in-home care for themselves or their loved ones online. I was brought on to redesign HelloNeighbor’s landing page and design a prototype of the company’s booking interface.</p>

                <h3 class="section-heading">Problem</h3>
                <p class="section-text">The question I was brought on to answer was, I was brought on to answer was, how can we design a simple, straight-forward solution that can be used by older, technologically literate, but not necessarily tech-savvy users to solve a complex challenge tied to even more complex emotions?</p>

                <p class="section-text">Because booking in-home care for loved ones is relatively rare and research done throughout the project showed that HelloNeighbor’s potential customers tended to be less tech-savvy and older users, I updated the presentation to focus on usability, accessibility, transparency, and trust.</p>
                <p class="section-text">The landing page was designed to quickly and easily establish exactly how HelloNeighbor works while using branding elements to convey a sense of trust and professionalism while at the same time being open and welcoming.</p>
                <p class="section-text">I designed the HelloNeighbor interface to let users quickly schedule, customize, purchase, and review care sessions. My primary goal was to alleviate as much stress and complexity from the booking process as possible. I worked to empower users and encourage engagement in all stages of the care process. Users can monitor the care they or their loved ones receive and provide feedback on HelloNeighbor care providers.</p>
