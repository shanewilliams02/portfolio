                <p class="section-text">I designed the HelloNeighbor interface to let users quickly schedule, customize, purchase, and review care sessions. My primary goal was to alleviate as much stress and complexity from the booking process as possible. I worked to empower users and encourage engagement in all stages of the care process. Users can monitor the care they or their loved ones receive and provide feedback on HelloNeighbor care providers.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">Before I was brought on, the team at HelloNeighbor had already done some market research, lo-fidelity prototyping, and created a single-page landing page site.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">I obviously wanted to honor the team's work. However, I knew that to understand the problem and work toward a potential solution, I’d need to develop a thorough understanding of the in-home care space, the competitive landscape, and most importantly, the challenges faced by both those seeking and providing care.</p>

                        <p class="section-text">I started my research by conducting a series of interviews with HelloNeighbor’s principal stakeholders to get a firm grasp on their vision for the company, their current understanding of the market, and their work before bringing me on. I spoke with HelloNeighbor’s CEO, one of their investors, and the front-end developer who designed the original HelloNeighbor landing page.</p>
                        <p class="section-text">Based on how the service works, the HelloNeighbor team knew that there would be two primary sets of users on the platform: those seeking care and HelloNeighbor-employed care providers. They also understood the critical role design would play in building and reinforcing trust.</p>
                        <p class="section-text">They had a picture of their users as older and less tech-savvy. I needed to perform research to either confirm or debunk that assumption. The team was also unaware of the other players were in the market. So that’s where I turned next.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">Starting with pen and paper, I sketched out numerous variations on designs for the landing page and the booking UI. By sketching first, I could rapidly explore a wide range of design possibilities and get feedback and input before committing to digital tools. Getting feedback early and often was essential.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">It was through feedback gathered using sketches that I discovered my initial landing page concepts didn't convey exactly how HelloNeighbor’s platform worked and was able to start working toward a possible solution.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">I took the basic design concepts and used Balsamiq to create lo-fidelity mockups which I then used to gather another round of user and stakeholder feedback. From here, I moved into creating hi-fidelity mockups in Sketch and crafted a clickable prototype with InvisionApp for user testing. </p>

                        <p class="section-text">All branding decisions were made to establish HelloNeighbor as trustworthy and professional as well as open and welcoming like, well a neighbor. During the research phase, I’d learned that HelloNeighbor would be catering to a variety of ages, physical and cognitive abilities and levels of tech-savviness. </p>
                        <p class="section-text">
                        I prioritized simplicity and readability in typography and a color palette that was both modern and bright but also professional and trustworthy.</p>
                        <h4 class="section-subheading">Color Palette</h4>
                        <p class="section-text">With HelloNeighbor’s brand refresh I opted for color, imagery, and typography that would immediately establish the company as friendly yet professional while being modern but familiar.</p>
                        <p class="section-text">I moved from the teal and Pantone green of the original styleguide to richer blues and greens often used by healthcare, banks, and social media companies. A safe choice? Sure, but these are the very companies we trust our money, health, data to and I believed HelloNeighbor could leverage those associations. </p>
                        <p class="section-text">More importantly, the original brand colors failed to meet accessibility contrast standards by a wide margin. So for the new palette, I worked until I found shades that met AA ( and AAA for large text) contrast standards. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-text">It was a delicate balancing act and took a good deal of tinkering with color pickers and contrast checkers but I was able to settle on a palette that would allow low-vision users to use HelloNeighbor while still conveying the company’s brand values.

                While requesting credit card info was a seen as a way to ensure the safety of HN staff conducting consultation sessions, users tested were suspicious of having to provide credit card info just to schedule a consultation to discuss care needs.

                    <li>Chose higher contrast brand colors to adhere to accessibility standards. </li>

                <p class="section-text">Unfortunately for a variety of reasons out of my control, HelloNeighbor never got off the ground. In spite of the project was incredibly valuable in my development as a designer. </p>
                <p>Looking back, there are countless things I'd change about how everything from how I handled certain areas of the design process, to my visual design choices (Easy on the heavy line-work there, kid! Also, remember there are colors besides green and blue).</p>

                <ul class="revisions-list">
                    <li>Be willing to <b>get creative</b> in finding survey participants. During the research phase, strapped for interview subjects I ended up cold-calling over of in-home care agencies to contact care professionals for interviews </li>
                    <li>Don't fall in love with your solutions, especially early on. <b>Explore as many options you can as early as possible</b> and avoid getting locked into a particular solution. I could have created much better solutions if I'd pushed myself further and been more comfortable iterating rapidly</li>
                    <li><b>First things first and that means mobile first</b> as new designer I was more comfortable designing for desktop. Also, based on what surveys and interviews told us about potential users' tech usage it seemed like a smart play to hold off on mobile. <br><br>This cost me in terms of time as well as leading me to make certain design decisions that wouldn't fare well responsively </li>
                    <li><b>Test everything with users</b> including lo-fi sketches via paper prototypes. I could have gathered valuable information feedback earlier in the design process saving time and effort when generating my high-fidelity mockups </li>
