                    <p class="section-text">HelloNeighbor is an in-home elder care startup created to help customers find, schedule, and purchase in-home care for themselves or their loved ones online. I was brought on to redesign HelloNeighbor’s landing page and design a prototype of the company’s booking interface.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">The question I was brought on to answer was, I was brought on to answer was, how can we design a simple, straight-forward solution that can be used by older, technologically literate, but not necessarily tech-savvy users to solve a complex challenge tied to even more complex emotions?</p>

                <p class="section-text">Because booking in-home care for loved ones is relatively rare and research done throughout the project showed that HelloNeighbor’s potential customers tended to be less tech-savvy and older users, I updated the presentation to focus on usability, accessibility, transparency, and trust.</p>
                <p class="section-text">The landing page was designed to quickly and easily establish exactly how HelloNeighbor works while using branding elements to convey a sense of trust and professionalism while at the same time being open and welcoming.</p>
                <p class="section-text">I designed the HelloNeighbor interface to let users quickly schedule, customize, purchase, and review care sessions. My primary goal was to alleviate as much stress and complexity from the booking process as possible. I worked to empower users and encourage engagement in all stages of the care process. Users can monitor the care they or their loved ones receive and provide feedback on HelloNeighbor care providers.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Background</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">Before I was brought on, the team at HelloNeighbor had already done some market research, lo-fidelity prototyping, and created a single-page landing page site.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">I obviously wanted to honor the team's work. However, I knew that to understand the problem and work toward a potential solution, I’d need to develop a thorough understanding of the in-home care space, the competitive landscape, and most importantly, the challenges faced by both those seeking and providing care.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">I started my research by conducting a series of interviews with HelloNeighbor’s principal stakeholders to get a firm grasp on their vision for the company, their current understanding of the market, and their work before bringing me on. I spoke with HelloNeighbor’s CEO, one of their investors, and the front-end developer who designed the original HelloNeighbor landing page.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">Based on how the service works, the HelloNeighbor team knew that there would be two primary sets of users on the platform: those seeking care and HelloNeighbor-employed care providers. They also understood the critical role design would play in building and reinforcing trust.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">They had a picture of their users as older and less tech-savvy. I needed to perform research to either confirm or debunk that assumption. The team was also unaware of the other players were in the market. So that’s where I turned next.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">To gain a thorough understanding of the in-home care space, I used Jaime Levy’s Competitive Analysis Matrix to audit the marketing sites and web applications of three major direct competitors: Honor, HomeTeamCare, and Carelinx. I was particularly interested in how these sites conveyed their value proposition, their onboarding processes, as well as how they conveyed professionalism and established trust through design.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">Then, I created a SWOT analysis of these companies to identify what opportunities HelloNeighbor could take advantage of to establish itself in the marketplace. </p>
                    <p class="section-text">I also curated a list of companies with track records of success in designing for our most vulnerable moments to serve as design inspiration, including Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft.</p>

                    <p class="section-text">To better understand the needs and challenges of care seekers and care providers I designed surveys to identify how people were already providing or finding care for their loved ones and how they coordinated care with their family members. I also wanted an overview of potential users’ technological behavior and their digital wardrobe.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">From professional care providers, I was eager to find out how they were matched with clients, any challenges they encountered in their work, and what methods and tools they currently used to keep track of their various clients and appointments.</p>
